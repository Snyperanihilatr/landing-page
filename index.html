<p>I made detailed mockups for almost every page of my website, which you can see not only in the pdf above but on the Idea Mache page linked above as well. The first mockup is the home page which consists of the sommoners rift map as well as links to the 3  content nodes. I then made mockups for the 3 content nodes: jungle, river and mid lane. I also made mockups for all the individual course nodes that correspond to each of the content nodes, however, not all of these are fully fleshed out with the  text describing each found object yet. To see a description of the interactive elements refer to the Idea Mache for deliverable 3. </p>
